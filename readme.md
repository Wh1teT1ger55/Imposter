# Imposter Gane

Imposter is a local party game for friends. Players are split into crewmates and imposters. Crewmates receive a secret word, while imposters do not. Each round, everyone gives a clue related to the wordâ€”close enough to hint, but not too obvious. After clues are shared, crewmates try to identify the imposters, while imposters attempt to guess the word.
